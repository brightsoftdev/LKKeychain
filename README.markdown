LKKeychain
=========

LKKeychain is a full-featured Objective-C wrapper for Mac OS X's Keychain API and some related subsystems in the Security Framework.
It requires Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard but it works even better on 10.7 Lion.

It supports listing, finding, adding, modifying and deleting generic passwords, internet passwords, certificates, public, private and symmetric keys.

I'm rapidly adding new functionality, but LKKeychain is not yet intended for production use.
